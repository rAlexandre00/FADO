## Training Script

At the client side, the client ID (a.k.a rank) starts from 1.
Please also modify config/fedml_config.yaml, changing the `worker_num` the as the number of clients you plan to run.

At the server side, run the following script:
```
bash run_server.sh your_run_id
```

For client 1, run the following script:
```
bash run_client.sh 1 your_run_id
```
For client 2, run the following script:
```
bash run_client.sh 2 your_run_id
```
Note: please run the server first.
